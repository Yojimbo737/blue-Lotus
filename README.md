# blue-Lotus
App that uses simple math to draw circular flower-like mandalas. This is a Beta version. 

My first attempt using C# and Xamarin and XAML on a UWP project. When I first started to learn C# and Xamarin, I got side tracked into developing a Skia Sharp graphics App. Flying blind, I pieced it together. Now I'm just posting the Beta version of the Coords class and the GUI code Setup.xaml.cs and Setup.xaml and they aren't actually the latest versions of those files. They need to be recovered. I've had some difficulty with my computer recently(possibly a hacker?) I will soon post the rest of the code later. I will post one of my favorite designs that is produced by the algorithm Clip1.png.
