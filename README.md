# blue-Lotus
App that uses simple math to draw circular flower-like mandalas. 

My first attempt using C# and Xamarin and XAML on a UWP project. When I first started to learn C# and Xamarin, I got side tracked into developing a Skia Sharp graphics App. Flying blind, I pieced it together. Now I'm just posting the GUI code Setup.xaml.cs and Setup.xaml. I've had some difficulty with my computer recently(possibly a hacker?) I will soon post the rest of the code later. I will post one of my favorite designs that is produced by the algorithm clip1.png.
